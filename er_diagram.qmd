title: "Entity Relationship Diagrams"
---

This simplified ER diagram shows the high-level relationships between the primary concepts 
in CoreCDM. In general, the Encounter table is used along with `Encounter_SID` 
as the primary key. However, the `Person_SID` foreign key can also be used to 
connect information across encounters if needed.
